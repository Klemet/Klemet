# 🍃 Bits of ecology

Welcome ! I am Clément (he/him), a postdoctoral fellow at the Université du Québec en Outaouais (UQO). I currently work on the long term and large scale impacts of [uneven-aged forest management](https://forestrypedia.com/even-aged-forests-vs-uneven-aged-forests/) on forest ecosystems in the DIVERSE project, which made me devellop several open-source tools for researchers.

Due to the nature of my research and my hobbies, I develloped through time some skills in programming, management, organisation and leadership. I tend to hone those skills by develloping and supporting [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software), and by helping different groups and projects with whom I collaborate in and out of my professional life. My strongest drive is to improve the way that we learn about the world and each other through effective communication, but also a better understanding of how humans lived, thought and acted since our humble beginnings as a species.
